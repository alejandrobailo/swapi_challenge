# POWEN Challenge

## Features

In addition to that who was asked, I implemented few features:
    
    - Change the color mode
    - Close dynamically the chart window


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.24.

To run it follow this steps:

I add this: 
apollo-angular 
apollo-angular-link-http 
apollo-client 
apollo-cache-inmemory 
graphql-tag 
graphql 
ng2-charts 
chart.js 
bootstrap

So in the root of your folder run

    npm install 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
